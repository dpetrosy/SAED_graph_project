## 📜 About project
#### Program finds spanning tree in user's inputted graph. For program correct work, you must have graphviz on your computer. Program work steps:
#### 1. Get graph edges by reading input file &nbsp;**<code>input.txt</code>**
#### 2. Build adjacency matrix for given graph
#### 3. By using adjacency matrix, make a simple graph from given graph.
#### 4. Check if simple graph is connected or not, because a given graph must be connected.
#### 5. If the graph is connected, find the spanning tree by using DFS algorithm.
#### 6. Visualize inputted graph and found spanning tree with graphviz.

## 👨‍💻 Getting Started
#### 1. Start by updating the packages list: &nbsp;**<code>sudo apt update</code>**
#### 2. Install GCC compiler, if you don't have: &nbsp;**<code>sudo apt install build-essential</code>**
#### 3. Check installation with command: &nbsp;**<code>g++ --version</code>**
#### 4. Make must install with build-essential, check it: &nbsp;**<code>make --version</code>**
#### 5. Install make package, if you don't have: &nbsp;**<code>sudo apt install make</code>**
#### 6. Clone this repo: &nbsp;**<code>git clone https://github.com/dpetrosy/graph_course_project.git</code>**


#### 7. Go to directory: &nbsp;**<code>cd graph_course_project</code>**
#### 8. Run make and build program: &nbsp;**<code>make</code>**
#### 9. Run executable: &nbsp;**<code>./graph.exe</code>**
#### 10. Congrats! Now you can see your inputted graph and found spannig tree :)
#### You can change **<code>input.txt</code>** file, and see how program works😎
